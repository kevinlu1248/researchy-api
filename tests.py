The inflammatory response orchestrates host defenses to microbial infection and mediates tissue repair and regeneration, which may occur due to infectious or non-infectious tissue damage. Epidemiological evidence points to a connection between inflammation and a predisposition for the development of cancer, i.e. long-term inflammation leads to the development of dysplasia. Epidemiologic studies estimate that nearly 15 percent of the worldwide cancer incidence is associated with microbial infection [<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="#R6" id="__tag_831364367" rid="R6">6</a>]. Chronic infection in immunocompetent hosts such as human papilloma virus or hepatitis B and C virus infection leads to cervical and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. In other cases, microbes may cause cancer due to opportunistic infection such as in Kaposiâ€™s sarcoma (a result of human herpes virus (HHV)-8 infection) or inappropriate immune responses to microbes in certain individuals, which may occur in gastric cancer secondary to <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> colonization or colon cancer because of long-standing inflammatory bowel disease precipitated by the intestinal microflora [<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="#R4" id="__tag_831364375" rid="R4">4</a>,<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="#R5" id="__tag_831364391" rid="R5">5</a>]. In many other cases, conditions associated with chronic irritation and subsequent inflammation predispose to cancer, such as the long-term exposure to cigarette smoke, asbestos, and silica [<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="#R4" id="__tag_831364370" rid="R4">4</a>,<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="#R5" id="__tag_831364372" rid="R5">5</a>]."""
